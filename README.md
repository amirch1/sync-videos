# Sync Videos
**Syncing 2 videos playback**

This demo shows how to sync playback of 2 videos using the following logic:
* Primary video used for audio (secondary video is muted)
* Combined play / pause / progress / seek events
* Offset threshold for synching by slowing down or speeding up the secondary video (default = 0.2 sec)
* Offset threshold for synching by seeking the secondary video to the primary video time (default = 2 sec)
